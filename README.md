# My NeetCode 150 Journey 🚀

This repository documents my personal journey and solutions for the **NeetCode 150** problem set. This is a curated list of 150 essential LeetCode problems designed to master the fundamental data structures and algorithms patterns needed for technical interviews.

This space serves as my personal log, a place to store my solutions, and a way to track my learning and improvement over time.

## ## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a topic from the NeetCode 150 list. Inside each folder, the solution files are named after the LeetCode problem.

```
.
├── 01-Arrays-and-Hashing
│   ├── 001-Contains-Duplicate.py
│   └── 242-Valid-Anagram.py
├── 02-Two-Pointers

## ## About My Solutions

Each solution file aims to include:
* A clean and efficient implementation of the solution in **Python**.
* Comments explaining the logic and approach.
* **Time and Space Complexity** analysis to understand the performance of the algorithm.

My primary goal is to master the underlying pattern of each topic, not just to memorize the solutions.

Happy coding!
